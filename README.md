### The Yellow Page

This website showcases Chinese-language web pages at the turn of the millennium. The web pages are collected from "Internet directory" books published in the late 1990s and early 2000s in mainland China, covering web pages produced by people based in Chinese-speaking regions and diaspora communities across the globe.

These directory books - often marketed as “yellow pages” of the Internet - provide lists of URLs of Chinese-language web pages organised into hierarchical categories for Chinese-speaking Internet users. These directory books provide insight into how the Internet was experienced and used by Chinese-speaking users at the turn of the millenium.

On this website, you can visit some of the URLs featured in these books via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

You can use the search box on the main page to search for web pages containing certain keywords in their titles or category information (to be implemented), or use the book filter on the right column to view web pages included in one particular directory book.
